# LUISS MaCS AI&ML Project Group 14 - Aeropolis

# Drone Cargo Capacity Prediction

## Problem Definition
This project aims to predict the cargo capacity of autonomous drones in the city of Aeropolis using various environmental and operational factors.

## Dataset
The dataset contains several features like weather conditions, terrain, and flight duration, which influence the drone's cargo capacity.

## Models
We used the following models for prediction:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

## Results
The Random Forest model performed the best with the lowest RMSE and highest R² after hyperparameter tuning. Below are the final metrics for all models.

- **Linear Regression**: RMSE = X, R² = Y
- **Random Forest**: RMSE = A, R² = B
- **SVR**: RMSE = P, R² = Q

## Future Work
We could improve performance by adding feature engineering or trying advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
